# lexigram skills

*how Lexigram teaches the AI in your editor to build with it.*

These are skill files for AI coding agents — Claude Code, OpenCode, and friends. Drop them into your agent, and when you ask it to wire a provider, scaffold a controller, or set up RAG, the agent reaches for the same patterns you would.

> **important — this is not a python package.** `lexigram-skills` is not on PyPI. `uv add lexigram-skills` will 404. These are markdown files (`SKILL.md`) consumed by AI coding agents, not python imports. The framework you'd `pip install` is **[lexigram](https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram)** — this repo only teaches your editor how to use it.

## install

Pick the agent you use. The skills are plain markdown — any tool that reads markdown context can use them; the recipes below are the smoothest paths for the popular ones.

### OpenCode

Project-scoped — add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["lexigram-skills@git+https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills.git"]
}
```

Globally — put the same `plugin` entry in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. Restart the agent; skills become discoverable via the `skill` tool.

### Claude Code

Symlink (recommended — stays in sync with upstream):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills.git ~/.lexigram-skills
ln -s ~/.lexigram-skills ~/.claude/skills/lexigram
```

Or copy a snapshot (no auto-update; good for pinning):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills.git
cp -r lexigram-skills/*/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

Restart Claude Code; the agent will discover skills via its standard skill loader.

### Cursor

Cursor reads `*.md` files from project rules and from `~/.cursor/rules/`. Either:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills.git .cursor/rules/lexigram
```

…or copy the specific `SKILL.md` files you want into `.cursor/rules/`. Cursor surfaces them to the model as ambient context; reference them by name in your prompt to bias the model toward them.

### Continue.dev, Cline, Aider, and other markdown-aware agents

Anything that consumes a project-level instructions directory can use these skills directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills.git
# point your agent's "rules" or "instructions" path at the cloned directory,
# or symlink individual SKILL.md files into your agent's expected location.
```

### Cherry-pick a single skill

If you only need one — say `ai-subsystem-quickstart` — copy just that folder:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills/archive/main.tar.gz \
  | tar -xzf - --strip-components=1 lexigram-skills-main/ai-subsystem-quickstart
```

Drop the resulting folder into your agent's skills directory.

### Pin a version

For reproducible setups, pin to a tag or commit instead of `main`:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills.git
```

(Replace the tag with whatever the current release is — see [releases](https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills/releases).)

## how a skill works

Each skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and a body of code-led examples. When you ask your AI agent to do something matching a skill's description, the agent loads that file and follows it. No magic, no plugins to write — just markdown your editor reads.

A skill is roughly: one task, twelve to a hundred lines of example code, a quick-reference table, and a short list of common mistakes. Easy to read, easy to extend.

## early on purpose

These skills track Lexigram 0.1.x. The framework is still soft; the skills move with it. If a skill steers you wrong, [open an issue](https://github.com/lexigram-framework/lexigram-skills/issues) — that's how the next release gets better.

## known gaps

A few skills we know we owe — pull requests welcome:

- **SSE / real-time web patterns.** No skill yet covers HTMX + SSE + `EventChannel` end-to-end.
- **Shared-queue lifecycle.** `creating-providers-and-modules` doesn't yet walk through subscribe/unsubscribe patterns where multiple owners share a queue (a real foot-gun in production).
- **`lexigram-ui` skill.** Component behavior and CDN dependencies aren't documented as a skill yet.
- **CSP guidance in `web-controllers-and-routing`.** Content-security-policy configuration is missing.

If you've solved one of these and want to share the pattern, see [contributing](#contributing).

## contributing

A new skill is a new directory with a single `SKILL.md` inside. Frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Use when …
---
```

Keep the body code-led. Lead with the "what you'd write" snippet, not prose. Each skill should answer one question and end with a quick-reference table.
